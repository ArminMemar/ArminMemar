## About Me

I'm a recent high school graduate with a strong passion for **mathematics**, **cryptography**, **machine learning**, and **data science**. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of theoretical mathematics and its real-world applications in secure communication and intelligent systems.

I am self-taught, highly motivated, and continuously learning through independent study and hands-on projects. I'm currently working with **Python**, focusing on how it can be used for cryptography and algorithm design. At the same time, I'm exploring the foundations of machine learning to better understand its mathematical underpinnings and practical implementations.

I aim to deepen my expertise and contribute to meaningful research in the future, while connecting with the broader scientific and engineering communities.
