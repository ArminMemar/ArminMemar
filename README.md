### About Me


I'm a recent high school graduate with a strong passion for mathematics, cryptography, machine learning, and data science. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of theoretical mathematics and its real-world applications in secure communication and intelligent systems. I am self-taught, motivated, and always eager to learn. I strive to deepen my understanding and connect with the broader scientific and engineering communities.
- I'm currently working with Python.
- I'm learning how to use Python in cryptography.
- I'm studying on my own to learn more about machine learning.
